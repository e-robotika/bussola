# geo:bit
Digital geological compass using micro:bit, and 3D printed case.

Accuracy average 3 degrees re. magnetic North

Accuracy clinometer better than 1 degree.

Uses 5x5 led display to display data fast, first column shows 100's, second and third column 10's, last two columns show 1's : example:

0 0 0 1 0 

0 1 0 1 0

0 1 0 1 1

1 1 0 1 1

1 1 0 1 1

which reads 248


python code can be adapted to suit needs, inlcuding strike dip, declination.

future code adaptations could include;
- average readings to increase accuracy
- adding data storage
- adding gps
- bluetooth data connection to mobile device
- sound, or speach
- etc

user guide included, building instructions in *introduction.pdf*, also on instructables,
3d printable casing (stl files) on thingiverse
